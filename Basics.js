//Variables
var a;
sus = 1;

var b = "sussy";
var c = "baka";
var d = b+c //will equal "sussybaka"

//Let Variables: let variables cannot have duplicate names, best practice to use instead of var
var e = 1;
var e = 2;

let f = 1;

// Const Variables: used for constant variables (unchangable variables), best practice to have it be all uppercase
const G = "hi";
//G = "Bye" //will cause error

//Special Math
let h = 20;
h++; //will result in 21 (adds one)
h--; //will result in 20 (subs one)

let remainder = 5%3; // will return 2 because when 5 is divided by 3 the will be two left over

//Strings
const I = "This \"baka\" is kind of a sussy \"baka\"" // will return: "This "baka" is kind of a sussy "baka""
